#Simple Genetic Algorithm 

## TODO
  * Implement Tests
  * Measure time spent in each iteration

## Summary
**Uses matplotlib** <br/>
Run the script as `python main.py`<br/>

It will create a file named result.txt where the results are going to be logged <br/>

It will print the iteration number and the number of the generation which reached the desired response<br/>

## Number of iterations

Run the script as `python main.py {\d}` to specify the number of iterations <br/>
Example: `python main.py 1` will run it once. <br/>
If there's no argument then it will run it 50 times as default.
